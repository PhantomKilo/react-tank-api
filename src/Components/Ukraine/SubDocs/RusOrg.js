        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Military strategy is built strategy. Meaning, you have to know what
          you are trying to accomplish, and how, then invest and build in that
          direction. Building a military based around an expeditionary role that
          specializing in counter-terrorism is VERY different than planning for
          the next world war. Both have unique requirements, and need a lot of
          time and resources to carry out. The doctrine, economic constraints,
          political goals, and culture of a country will further focus what a
          military looks like. Iran during the Iran-Iraq war was under massive
          embargos, so couldn't replenish the parts for their western equipment,
          as well as purging their officer corps of the regular army. The
          doctrine and force structure changed to reflect this, becoming more
          infantry heavy and using the limited modern airpower to hit economic
          weakpoints of Iraq. A large amount of Irans performance could be
          explained by this alone, making this a pretty important factor in
          taking anything away from this war. Now obviously this isn't the only
          factor, but it's a good starting point. Hard to launch mechanized
          operation when you can't mechanize your troops. Anyway, thats a very
          simplified background that will make more sense the more you know.

        <h2>The post-Soviet Russian military</h2>
        <p>
          The Russian Federation never recovered from the fall of the Soviet
          Union. The economic turmoil of the 90s saw massive budget cuts and a
          level of corruption previously unseen in the Soviet system. The break
          up of territory took a chunk of the modern, in service hardware with
          it to countries like Ukraine, Belorus or Germany that had been
          stationed there. The first Chechnyan war was a disaster, with
          untrained, uninformed Russian troops getting ripped to shreds by
          Afghan War vets who used their experience to their advantage to ambush
          and destroy armored formations due to a lack of infantry and training.
          Eqiupment was being stolen and being sold on the black market for
          either state income or person gain, depending on whether it was
          tracked or not. While many within the Russian government knew about
          the deficientcies not much was done until the war with Georgia in
          2008. Being on the international stage put the sad reality in the
          worlds face. Decades old equipment, lack of any body armor,
          disorganized and using unencrypted communications. Georgia was an even
          bigger mess, so Russia won, but instituted the beginning of
          modernization efforts that would continue through the 2022 invasion of
          Ukraine.

        <h2>Russia military Corruption</h2>
        <p>
          One of many elephants in the room regarding the state of the Russian
          military. Corruption exists in most organizations to a certain extent,
          but is unique in the east. After 1991 there was no money for much of
          anything in the military, including salaries in many cases. With the
          turmoil of the 90s keeping track of all the surplus equipment was not
          anywhere close to being a priority. Generals sold off as much as they
          could get away with, helocopters, tanks and ships. Not to mention the
          thousands of small arms, heavy weapons and sometimes more advanced
          systems. Of course, non of this was really noticed and the full extent
          will never be known. On a smaller scale is Russian troops selling
          their weapons to Chechnyans and peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia
          selling off their fuel. Supply troops stealing newer body armor during
          the modernization efforts and putting it up for sale, hoping there was
          no war coming. Capital set aside for upgrade and modernation programs
          was funneled to non military causes, such as mega yachts and
          international bank accounts. Then there are the lower level logistics
          officers who cheapen out on parts, or just waste time collecting a
          paycheck without doing work. Unit commanders using conscripts to build
          civil projects instead of training and pocketing the salaries for
          themselves. Of course, this a simplified look into the issue, because
          it runs much deeper.

        <h2>Modernization programs</h2>
        <p>
          Following the war with Georgia in 2008 it was apparent that the
          Russian military needed a major upgrade to bring them into the 21st
          century. Of course, watching the US pull new hardware out of thin air
          only made the out dated, under equipped Russian army look even further
          more behind.
