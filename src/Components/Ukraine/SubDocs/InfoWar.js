              Information Warfare
            </a>
            &nbsp;as an operation conducted to gain an information advantage
            over the opponent. The ultimate goal is to dominate the information
            environment and deny its use to the enemy. The use of bot armies and
            troll farms to both spread disinformation and attack enemies in an
            effort to discredit or silence. Cyber warfare is used to directly
            steal from or destroy enemy information systems. Information warfare
            in a general context has been around as long as conventional war
            has, but due to the advent of the internet has become much easier to
            wage. A recent example of an effective campaign was Azerbaijan
            posting videos and pictures of Armenian pows and casualties while
            hiding their own, making it seem as if they were dominating the
            battlefield, even as they lost almost as many troops as Armenia.
            They also went after pro Armenia social media accounts, flooding
            them with pro Azerbaijani propaganda or getting them removed.
            Azerbaijan set a new standard for how to wage a modern information
            war. Other countries like Russia spread conspiracy theories and
            other disinformation, like pushing pro Brexit and Qanon media. Info
            warfare tends to bleed into other areas, like political and
            psychological warfare, and is probably the biggest application for
            cyber warfare (that I'm aware of). The point is, this is a HUGE
            topic, with many hours of conferences, how it fits itno "hybrid
            warfare" (which is then part of the "gray zone"...), so the full
            spectrum is out of scope for this place.

          <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to at least be aware of what goes on around a war,
            especially the biggest land war in Europe since WWII. Misinformation
            is everywhere, and neither party has a reason to disprove much of
            it. Russia is spreading nonsense to confuse third party observers
            and weaken the morale of Ukrainian troops and their supporters
            worldwide. Lying about their intentions, overplaying their successes
            and hiding the failures. Ukraine has been doing the same thing in
            many ways, showing the world how commited they are to fighting. Many
            parties (wrongfully) assumed they would collapse much like the
            Afghan government, and their goal is to disprove that notion. This
            means much of the coverage is based on incomplete and very biased
            information. A big example is the claim that tanks are obsolete
            because of the proliferation of anti-tank missiles and drone
            launched munitions. The narrative leading up to the invasion had
            everyone thinking that Russia would roll over Ukraine with mass
            amounts of tanks and other armored vehicles with little resistence.
            When that didn't happen, and pictures of hundreds of abandoned and
            destroyed tanks appeared over social media, they showed to not only
            their own people that victory was possible, but also helped create a
            oft repeated narrative around tanks that comes up every year. The
            reality is that Russia was (probably) much closer to achieving what
            they were trying to do in Kyiv than originally thought, and the
            Ukrainians had to pull out all the stops (like flooding parts of the
            suburbs) to stop them.

          <h2>Russian Information Warfare</h2>
          <p>
            The Russian government had planned on blowing through Ukraine in a
            few days, and leaving altogther within a few months. As a result,
            the early campaign was focused on showing Ukraine as a corrupt,
            dangerous country who threatened Russia directly. They were painted
            as "nazis", using the Azov battalion as proof of this. Conspiracy
            theories were spread about bioweapons labs set up eith the help of
            the CIA to exterminate Russians. Claiming that NATO, or other
            western nations, gave reason for Russia to defend themselves. Part
            of trying to control the info domain was attempting to destroy the
            primary broadcast tower in Kyiv to cut off their ability to
            broadcast or receive transmissions, leaving Russia as the only info
            source. After the initial plan failed however, the focus changed.
            They hid their enormous amount of casualties and denied commiting
            warcrimes like the Bucha massacre. Highlighting what success they
            have, mostly small bombed out villages and pgm and drone strikes
            lately. The goal today seems to be trying to still project
            themselves as a great power to both external and (mostly) internal
            audiences. One last note is that Russian troops had to leave their
            phones at home for the most part, unlike the Ukrainian troops, so
            ground level coverage of the war from the Russian front is limited.
            There are quite a few other aspects that may or may not be related
            to the Ukraine war (Brexit weakens the UK, but is it motivated by UK
            support for Ukraine?), and how information warfare fits into the
            greater irreguler warfare umbrella. One major thing is clear, as far
            as the world is concerned, Russia has lost the ingo war at this time
            and as a result has united most of the West against them for the
            forseable future.

          <h2>Ukrainian Information Warfare</h2>
          <p>
            The Ukrainians, to contrast with Russia, have been wildly successful
            in taking over the information domain. When Russia failed to achieve
            their goals in the first few days, Ukraine responding by rallying
            around the president and getting the west to ramp up support in the
            form of sweet, sweet ATGMs, such as Javelins and NLAWs, and surplus
            tanks from countries like Poland. The Ukrainain president, Volodymyr
            Zelenskyy, survived early Russian attempts to grab him and rallied
            his people to defend the nation. Ukrainain civilians spent all their
            free time during the first part of the war posting pictures and
            videos of destroyed Russian equipment and KIAs. Helped by Russian
            incompetence, early drone footage from TB2s, among other systems,
            where they were dropping bombs on, or recording other fires like
            artillery, against tank and other armored vehicle groups. The famous
            "Tractor Brigade" of UKraine was towing away multi-million dollar
            systems like the Pantsir-S1 air defense system and various modern
            tank models. Videos of Ukrainian losses are harder to find, being
            drowned out of Russian losses, indicating that they are being shared
            much more liberally than the Russian origin media. It's clear that
            Ukraine controls the mainstream narrative, to a degree that there is
            discontent within Russia being that more than 4 million people have
            left the country since the war has began. Of course, seeing as the entire
            developed world is united in isolating Russia, Ukraine is seen as
            a bastion of democracy and have their future in the EU and NATO fast
            tracked is a sign of winning the information domain.
