        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The years immediately following the fall of the USSR saw a massive
          wave of violence across a large part of former soviet territory (the
          term "balkanization" was coined to describe 90s eastern europe).
          Yugoslavia broke into a three way civil war, Chechnya made a move to
          break from Russia, and Armenia seized the Nagorno-Karabakh region from
          Azerbaijan. From 1994, until 2020, the region was governed over by an
          Armenian puppet government, the Republic of Artsakh. In 2020,
          Azerbaijan attacked and retook a majority of the region, achieving a
          total victory. The combination of a better funded military, serious
          modernization and integration of drones to support the more
          conventional forces gave Azerbaijan the edge it needed.

        <h2>How is this war connected to Ukraine?</h2>
        <p>
          The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war showcased much of the technology and
          tactics currently used during the fighting in Ukraine. Wide spread use
          of drones to both dirctly engage targets and spot for artillery, the
          use of social media by both governments that engaged in Information
          warfare, and newer tactics by Azerbaijan against older soviet tactics
          and force structure. This war, somewhat of a precursor to the current
          war in Ukraine, is a good reference point in many ways to show how the
          lanscape of war has changed. Much of what happend in this war,
          factoring for cultural and regonal differences, is being repeated in
          Ukraine by both sides.

        <h2>Armenian organization and equipment</h2>
        <p>
          Armenia's military was based around old Soviet doctrine and equipment.
          The country enjoyed an advantage over their Azerbaijani neighbors in
          both cordination and hardware in 1994, during the first
          Nagorno-Karabakh war. For whatever reason, they decided to keep their
          military nearly identical, foregoing modernization or force structure
          oerhaul. Armenia did integrate drones into their inventory, but at
          much more limited use compared to Azerbaijan. The focus was mostly on
          heavier, mechanized forces with large concentration of tanks, mostly
          T-72s. Air defense systems were limited to older, shorter range
          platforms due to deploying most of their modern platforms along their
          northern border.
